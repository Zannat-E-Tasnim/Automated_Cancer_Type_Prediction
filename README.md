Automated Cancer Type Prediction Using Gene Expression Based On Deep Learning Model

Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with high mortality rates and significant healthcare costs.
Early detection and accurate classification of cancer types are critical for improving treatment and survival rates.
Traditional diagnostic methods are often invasive, time-consuming, and may lack precision.
A hybrid GCN-CNN model  leverages both types of features, improving prediction accuracy and providing better biological interpretability.
